The future belongs to those of us who, despite it all, are still willing to get our hands dirty. /n
Effort is the only factor that affects success.
Age is not a factor. Experience is not a factor. Intelligence is not a factor.
Your willingness to break through and overcome obstacles will be your greatest ally.
Look to it in your times of need.
Success is effort, compounded through persistence.
The smallest steps today may lead to great leaps some day.
There is such a thing as progress for the sake of progress.
We call it evolution...
